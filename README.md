## Hi, I'm Kenny, thanks for checking out my project!!!

**Some of the JavaScript Implementations used:**

* Date Object (Of Course : -) ).
* Module Design Pattern.
* Array methods( `map()` ).
* Recursion (The Stack Overflowed!!!).
* Destructuring Assignment.
* Object Destructuring.
* Default Parameters.
* Functions taking functions as arguments.
* Stand-alone functions executing multiple actions to the UI, the likes of `setStyle(), classAction(), insertHTML(), setProp()` to hounor **Abstraction**.
* You can navigate calendar with keyboard or button clicks.
* And More...

*I'm still gonna implement Holidays & Event Reminders in the App. I decided I'm gonna release it on my Repo at this stage. I'll keep you posted. Also **I need a better design, any suggestion? Feel free to raise issues.***

*Thanks for checking me out!!!*
